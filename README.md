# Generic-Genetic-Algorithm
A generic algorithm to solve various problems in a genetic manner.

This project is a test ground for making a generic genetic algorithm than can ideally solve most problems by using some kind of crossover and mutation

# Travelling Salesman Problem
this reposotory contains a travelling salesman problem and the solver using this algorithm.
feel free to try it and do pull requests :) 
the code is not commented yet so it will take a while to understand.
